v2.0.0
removed CardTableLayoutStrategy class and placed it's functionality into CardTableLayout
client now extends CardTableLayout to create a custom layout for each game
removed init() and persistence from CardTableLayoutMapper class; client can just create a new Mapper on game init()

v2.0.1
imported latest CardTablePosition package (1.0.1) with slight bug fix

v3.0.0
removed constructor from CardTableLayout class and replaced with init()
cannot easily call abstract methods in a parent constructor because "this" context gets incorrectly assigned
solution is to call the abstract method in init() method on parent instead
